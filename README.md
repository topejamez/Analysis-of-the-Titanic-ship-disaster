# Analysis-of-the-Titanic-ship-disaster

### Project Overview

I analyzed the Titanic ship disaster using Python and primarily focused on understanding the factors that contributed to passenger survival and identifying key insights from the available dataset to first, understand the distribution of passengers based on demographic and socio-economic factors. Secondly, identify the key factors that influenced survival rates. And lastly, draw actionable insights for safety improvements in maritime travel.

### Data Source

Kaggle is the source of the dataset in CSV file. Python programming language on Kaggle is used to clean the dataset, format, transform, group, and carry out the analysis. Libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

To gain insights from a dataset, it is important to ensure the dataset is clean enough for doing that. I ensured the dataset was thoroughly cleaned to ensure the accuracy and integrity of my findings. The dat_cleaning processes I carried out include:

 1. Importing Panda and the Titanic dataset
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    titanic_train = pd.read_csv('input/titanic/train.csv')
